# üìë Human-Computer Interaction Report

*Human-Computer Interaction Report was completed as a coursework for the CSC8022 module(Human-Computer Interaction) taught for the MSc Computer Science programme within the School of Computing at Newcastle University during the 2023/2024 Academic Year.*

This report aimed to provide the documentation of two consisting parts: Part I aimed to underline the importance of HCI on contemporary computing by additionally providing the history of HCI and Part II aimed to conduct and report the usability evaluation of the Forest App, using the Cooperative Evaluation method.

# ‚Ñπ About the Human-Computer Interaction Report

The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Report serves to summarize key insights gained throughout the module. It also includes a usability evaluation, complemented by a detailed report on the testing process and its findings.

# üîñ Achievements

***The report successfully:***
- Defined HCI, its history and relatability to the different understanding of users influencing the field.
- Contrasted the key methods, approaches and techniques used across HCI.
- Compared the differences between usability and experiential approaches to developing and evaluating digital technology.
- Categorised the tangible, ubiquitous, mobile and graphical computing paradigms and identified the suitability of these approaches in different contexts.
- Justified the importance of developing and evaluating technologies beyond usability.
  
***The learning outcomes achieved upon the completion of this project were summarised below.***
- Gathered, synthesised and evaluated information and literature about the field of HCI.
- Held research on the technical examples from personal experiences and research exemplars.
- Identified the challenges for interaction between contexts, users and different technologies.
- Ran usability evaluations and evaluated the data from these evaluations.
- Suggested and synthesised design recommendations based on the evaluation data.

# üìÑ Program Output

Part I - Delivered a brief history of HCI and its relevance to contemporary computing by providing the definition, aim and historical development of HCI, as well as an introduction to the world of AI and Machine Learning in our living spaces, impact evaluation of such on HCI, and lastly drew attention to the potential opportunities as well as challenges of AI and Machine Learning.

>___An Excerpt from Part I on Findings:___
> `"To conclude, in the forthcoming years, the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) holds significant promise and accompanying challenges (Russell & Norvig, 2022). These technologies offer transformative potential across various sectors, facilitating advanced automation, customized interactions, and refined decision-making processes (Floridi & Cowls, 2019). As AI and ML become increasingly integrated into everyday life, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity becomes imperative (Mittelstadt et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved alongside technological advancements, fundamentally altering our interactions with computers (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017). Through the integration of AI and ML, HCI has facilitated customized experiences in sectors such as healthcare and entertainment. Future advancements promise further innovation, exemplified by products like Apple Vision Pro, which offer tailored virtual environments. Challenges persist, including dispelling misconceptions and ensuring fair access. By prioritizing a user-centric approach, HCI can continue to drive progress while addressing societal concerns, remaining instrumental in shaping the future of computing for enhanced user experiences."`

Part II - Brought a usability report using the cooperative evaluation method(also known as Think Aloud Protocol). This report consisted of an executive summary, product details, user test details and evaluation results with incident logs, rated in terms of severity. The application chosen to be evaluated was Forest App by SEEKRTECH CO., LTD.

>___An Excerpt from Part II on Evaluation Results:___
> `"Incident Log [1]
Incident Description: 
While performing Task 2, two of the users struggled to find where the modes are. They searched through the Menu. The icons leading to modes are too small and therefore users have stated they either didn‚Äôt notice them, or didn‚Äôt think the modes would be in there. One of them said that he thought those were toggle buttons, to switch something on and off, and that it wouldn‚Äôt lead to a pop-up, before tapping them. The users stated they got really frustrated.
Severity Rating: [4]"`
