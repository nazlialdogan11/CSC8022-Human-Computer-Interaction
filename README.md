# üìë Human-Computer Interaction Report

*Human-Computer Interaction Report was completed as a coursework for the CSC8022 module(Human-Computer Interaction) taught for the MSc Computer Science programme within the School of Computing at Newcastle University during the 2023/2024 Academic Year.*

This report aimed to provide the documentation of two consisting parts: Part I aimed to underline the importance of HCI on contemporary computing by additionally providing the history of HCI and Part II aimed to conduct and report the usability evaluation of the Forest App, using the Cooperative Evaluation method.

# ‚Ñπ About the Human-Computer Interaction Report

The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Report serves to summarize key insights gained throughout the module. It also includes a usability evaluation, complemented by a detailed report on the testing process and its findings.

# üîñ Achievements

***The report successfully:***
- Defined HCI, its history and relatability to the different understanding of users influencing the field.
- Contrasted the key methods, approaches and techniques used across HCI.
- Compared the differences between usability and experiential approaches to developing and evaluating digital technology.
- Categorised the tangible, ubiquitous, mobile and graphical computing paradigms and identified the suitability of these approaches in different contexts.
- Justified the importance of developing and evaluating technologies beyond usability.
  
***The learning outcomes achieved upon the completion of this project were summarised below.***
- Gathered, synthesised and evaluated information and literature about the field of HCI.
- Held research on the technical examples from personal experiences and research exemplars.
- Identified the challenges for interaction between contexts, users and different technologies.
- Ran usability evaluations and evaluated the data from these evaluations.
- Suggested and synthesised design recommendations based on the evaluation data.
